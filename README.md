# 🥤 Coca-Cola Unified Brand Experience – UI/UX Prototype

Welcome to my UI/UX concept project designed to unify Coca-Cola, Fanta, and Sprite under one sleek, reusable web interface.

This portfolio project demonstrates **component-based design, brand identity integration**, and **visual storytelling** using Figma.

## 📌 Project Overview

**Problem:**  
Beverage brands often have scattered digital experiences. This concept solves that by offering a **single web experience** where different drink flavors live under one cohesive layout — each with its own unique color theme and personality.

**Goal:**  
- Showcase multiple Coca-Cola sub-brands (Coke, Fanta, Sprite)  
- Use **reusable UI components**  
- Maintain visual consistency while giving each flavor its own identity  
- Create a portfolio-ready piece to demonstrate UI/UX capability

- 🧃 Bold hero sections for each flavor
- ✏️ Flavor-specific color schemes (orange, red, purple, green)
