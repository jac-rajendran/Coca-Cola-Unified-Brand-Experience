# 🥤 Coca-Cola Unified Brand Experience – UI/UX Prototype

A UI/UX case study that reimagines the digital presence of Coca-Cola and its sub-brands — Fanta and Sprite — under a **unified, responsive, and component-based design system**.

This concept explores reusable layouts, flavor-specific themes, and **light/dark mode** implementations to show real-world design thinking and branding consistency.

## 📌 Project Overview

**Challenge:**  
How can a multi-brand beverage company like Coca-Cola deliver a unified digital experience while celebrating each sub-brand's unique vibe?

**Solution:**  
Design a single-page layout system where different Coca-Cola products (Coke, Fanta, Sprite) each take the spotlight through color, imagery, and smooth transitions — while keeping UI components reusable and brand-consistent.
